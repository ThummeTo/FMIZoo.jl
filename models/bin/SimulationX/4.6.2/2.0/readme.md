# Description of FMU samples:

*SpringPendulum1D.fmu*: Simplified FMU from SimulationX consisting of an one-dimensional spring pendulum without friction.

*SpringFrictionPendulum1D.fmu*: Simplified FMU from SimulationX consisting of an one-dimensional spring pendulum including a nonlinear friction model.

*Powertrain.fmu*: A complex FMU of a powertrain from SimulationX with 7 states and multiple state events, which can be used for testing of pre-/postprocessing and gates implementation for NeuralFMUs in FMIFlux.
