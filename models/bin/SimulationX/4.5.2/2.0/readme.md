# Description of FMU samples:

*SpringPendulum1D.fmu*: Simplified FMU of SimulationX consists of an one-dimensional spring pendulum without friction.

*SpringFrictionPendulum1D.fmu*: Simplified FMU of SimulationX consists of an one-dimensional spring pendulum including a nonlinear friction model.

*SpringFrictionPendulum1Dparameter_k.fmu*: A FMU of SimulationX consists of an one-dimensional spring pendulum with a nonlinear friction including the parameter [spring.k] that can be changed/customized to vary the number of state events.

*PowertrainWithRequirements.fmu*: A complex FMU of a powertrain in SimulationX with 7-states and multiple state events, which can be used for testing of pre-/postprocessing and gates implementation for NeuralFMUs in FMIFlux.
